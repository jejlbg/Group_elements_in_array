Questions:
- What is the big O notation of your algorithm? Please explain in detail.

  The big O notation of the sort algorithm would be O(n^3) in the worst case because we have three for-loops. The first loop is going through the whole
array in every case so this would be n, the second loop would in the worst case go through the whole array -2 and the third loop would also in the worst case
go through the whole array -2.
Of cause Í have more loops in the whole program, but only because I have to read the values into the array and print the elements out. 
So in total it would be O(n^6).

- Would the big O notation or the algorithm be any different if the array is filled with
ASCII alpha-numeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) only instead of integers?

  No, because the Algorithm sorts unique Elements. It doesn´t matter if the element is called "11232" or "aaFSawd".

- Please describe what algorithm you would use to sort the array of re-organized integers.
What is the big O notation this algorithm? 

  I would use the quicksort algorithm. The O notation would be O(n^2) in the worst case.
